# Graphics-Framework

Personal graphics framework used to study graphics programming topics.

## Credits
- To get up to speed with OpenGL, I use:
  - [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com)
  - [Cherno](https://github.com/TheCherno)'s awesome [OpenGL Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) on YouTube.
  Also, some textures are taken from learnopengl.com as well.
- The book [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](https://gamemath.com) (along with various other sources) was used as the basis for math algorithms & classes.
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) from the [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) library was used for texture i/o.
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) is used for the user interface.
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) is used for windowing & other platform-specific needs.
- [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) is used as the loader for OpenGL functions.
